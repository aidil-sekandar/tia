> "I really enjoyed today's session because I get to learn the different types of volunteering since I've always thought that volunteering is just like helping out a community but it's actually more of it! Besides that, I also get to learn how to build an actual, effective and simple resume since I just finished my SPM last month and I hope to create a better resume for further application ^^.”

> "I am more exposed to the true definition of professionalism as it is not always about your etiquettes and attire. I will surely practice all the qualities and skills that have been elaborated by the presenter in the future. This session has also boosted my confidence level as it encourages me to be involved in more activities and programmes in the future as I can apply what I had learnt today effectively."
