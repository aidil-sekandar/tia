## Introduction

The project Comprehensive Exam Guide is a project to compile state trial papers from 2017 to 2023 for different subjects chapter by chapter with the respective answer schemes. It allows Form 4 and Form 5 students to drill on challenging state trial questions after learning each chapter. Project details are as follows:

Date: April 2023 - Ongoing  
Mode: Online

## Objectives

The main objective of this project is to assist Form 4 and Form 5 students in consolidating the important facts of each chapter. This would help them become familiar with the format and types of questions that could potentially be asked in an actual exam. At the same time, students could also identify areas where they needed to improve. Furthermore, practising on trial exam papers helps build confidence before the student takes the actual exam.

## Collaborations

We are honoured to have had the opportunity to work with 3 student-led bodies for this project. Our collaborators each sent a group of volunteers who took time out of their busy schedules to contribute to the compilation of SPM trial papers. Our collaborators and their respective subjects  are listed in the table below:

## Impact

As students continue to search for topical SPM trial papers, Comprehensive Exam Guide serves as a guide to students who struggle with handling the varying types of questions they may encounter in the exam hall. The Comprehensive Exam Guide has also been used as a tool for the Resource Department to increase interactions amongst tutees in TIA’s Tutee Study Group on Telegram. Engaging material will be sent to the group for students to practise with every week. Not only does this project catalyse TIA’s growth as a non-profit organisation, Comprehensive Exam Guide also helps in bridging the educational barrier we are currently facing. 

## Conclusion

The Comprehensive Exam Guide was and is still a huge success, all thanks to our reliable committee members, hardworking volunteers as well as supportive students. TIA wishes to impact more students in the future by taking this project as an inspiration and motivation to move forward.
