## Introduction

With hopes of becoming TIA’s first flagship event, ‘SPM In Action’ (SIA) is a series of intensive workshops conducted by
SPM subject teacher guest speakers seeking to provide SPM students with subject-specific insights for free. SIA involves
a ‘crash-course’ style itinerary that offers students a unique opportunity to learn and review the key information of
several subjects within a short duration. We believe this will prove useful in gathering key information specific to
each subject, in addition to consolidating their grasp of commonly assessed questions and topics. SIA seeks to provide
SPM students with a synergistic environment to ask questions, clarify doubts and share their ideas. Our primary target
audience is SPM 2023 students from various locations as workshop contents will be specifically tailored to SPM 2023
examinations.

Event details are as follows:

Date: 9th - 10th December 2023  
Time: 8:00 a.m. - 6:30 p.m.  
Mode: Hybrid

- Physical Venue: Taylor's University Lakeside Campus
- Online: Youtube Livestream (https://www.youtube.com/@tutorsinactionmalaysia)

## Collaborations

We are honoured to have collaborated with 4 student-led bodies for this project. Our collaborators each planned a
fundraising event on their own wherein the type of event held was up to their discretion, and profits earned were
directed to ‘SPM In Action’. Our collaborators and their respective contributions are listed in the table below:

## Crowdfunding

TIA has held crowdfunding to raise funds from the public. We received donations via two platforms, DuitNow and online
bank transfer. 100% of donations collected from crowdfunding funded the expenses of SIA.

## Impact

SPM In Action managed to gather and benefit 90 participants on Day 1 and 120 participants on Day 2 to participate in our
workshop series at Taylor’s University Lakeside Campus, including Closing the Gap (CTG) scholars and SPM students from
Trinity Community Children Home. Both days of the SPM In Action Youtube Livestream also gathered more than 2500
accumulated views as of 23 December 2023.
Hard-copy workshop notes were printed and distributed to all participants to help participants follow the workshops
easily. Lunch was provided for all participants on both days. Exciting prizes such as Starbucks gift cards and Grab
vouchers were available to be won by participants upon answering post-workshop questions correctly to encourage their
participation in the workshop series. All these benefits were subsidised completely by the event’s funding, and no fees
were imposed onto participants.
