## Introduction

Project ‘Choices Ahead!’ is a series of online workshops, including **'Workshop 1: Introduction to Pre-U Programmes'**
and **'Workshop 2: Scholarship Application Preparation'** that aims to introduce SPM candidates to their possible
post-SPM pathways and how to prepare for them.

Additional objectives:

1. Narrow educational opportunity gap between applicants from various backgrounds and statuses.
2. Create diverse opportunities for TIA tutors to share their post-SPM experiences.

## Collaborations

We feel privileged to have had the opportunity to work with 27 speakers from diverse educational backgrounds in this 
project. Specifically, 10 speakers for Workshop 1 and 17 speakers for Workshop 2. Each of our collaborators diligently 
crafted informative slides to present their experiences from either pre-university or scholarship backgrounds. You can
