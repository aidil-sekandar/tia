## Introduction

‘Choices Ahead! 2.0’ is an extension of the ‘Choices Ahead!’ workshop that was previously launched in 2023, involving a series of online workshops aimed at introducing SPM graduates to various post-SPM pathways and need-based scholarships available in Malaysia. The workshops will also equip them with necessary skills needed in order to prepare for scholarship applications and further studies applications: CV building, personal statement and essay writing, and interview skills, helping to enhance their chances of securing a scholarship.
