## Introduction

Project ‘Joy for Angels’ is a fundraising project to aid children who have been neglected, abused or abandoned, or face financial constraints in pursuing their education.

Our main objective of this fundraising project is to raise funds so as to provide educational
support for children from our beneficiaries. Additional objectives are as stated below:

1. To raise and spread awareness regarding the dire monetary help orphaned children and as a subsequent, orphanages require to cover their education-related expenses.
2. To instil kindness, compassion and selflessness within the general public, particularly among adolescents.
3. To help fund TIA’s main project of providing free tutoring services to underprivileged SPM students.

## Crowdfunding

TIA has held crowdfunding to raise funds from the public. We received donations via two platforms, Touch ‘n Go eWallet and online bank transfer. A Google form was created to collect proof of donation and for documentation purposes. 90% of donations collected from crowdfunding was funded to our beneficiaries while the remaining 10% of the donations was directed to TIA’s funds for future projects benefiting underprivileged SPM students.

## Visits to the Beneficiaries

Supplemented with products from our generous sponsors, we visited the beneficiaries on 2nd April 2023 to spend some time with the children. Prior to the visit, we collected encouraging and motivational messages from our donors and collaborators, and combined them into a small notebook for the children’s keepsake. We had the opportunity to interact with the children through a fun origami session hosted by Taylor’s University Lakeside Campus C.S.I. Volunteers.

## Financial Summary
