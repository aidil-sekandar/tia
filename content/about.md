Founded in 2020, Tutors In Action Malaysia (TIA) is an independent, student-led national organisation with a mission and
vision to provide assistance to underprivileged Malaysian youth, predominantly focusing on aiding and guiding SPM
students throughout their SPM journey.

The organisation, initially formed with the sole agenda of preparing Form 5 students for their SPM national
examinations, had acted as a bridge between volunteer tutors and tutees and provided a platform for volunteer tutors to
conduct one-to-one lessons with their tutees. We further supported our tutees in achieving their academic goals by
curating various resources and engaging in our very own study group. Our project has since expanded past our initial
vision and as of October 2022, Tutors in Action Malaysia has been successfully recognised as a national organisation by
EROS.

As TIA continues to expand, we have broadened our prospects to extend our services to the underserved
Malaysian youth, be it secondary school students in the B40 community or orphaned children seeking shelter in children’s
homes. While our philanthropic efforts once covered only one-to-one tuition, we now envision TIA’s future to be one rich
with collaborations, fundraisers, group tutoring and much more.
